# Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a professional portfolio showcasing my progress as a front-end developer during the first year of Noroff's Frontend Development (FED1) course. This portfolio highlights three major projects, illustrating my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with responsive web design and best practices in documentation.

# Description
This portfolio presents three of my key projects from the first year:

- Cross-Course Project: Originally built with HTML and CSS, with JavaScript added later to enhance functionality.
- Semester Project 1: A design-focused project aimed at creating a responsive, multi-page website using advanced CSS and HTML.
- Project Exam 1: A dynamic, JavaScript-driven blog platform integrated with an API for real-time blog management.

### Each project is represented as a card containing:
- The project title
- A brief description
- A screenshot of the project
- Links to the GitHub repository and live demo

### Key features of the portfolio:
- Responsive Design: Ensures the portfolio is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Project Showcase: Each project is displayed with key details and interactive links.
- Professional Documentation: Includes information on how to access and use the code for each project.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout the development of this application, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Structuring content and creating visually appealing layouts using only HTML and CSS.
- Organizing multiple projects and their descriptions in a professional manner.
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design for diverse screen sizes.
- Writing clear and comprehensive project documentation.

# Project Technologies
- HTML: The backbone of the portfolio's structure and content.
- CSS: Styling to create a professional, responsive layout without the use of frameworks.
- GitHub Pages: The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone. 

### Development Tools
- Figma: Used for wireframing and designing the user interface.
- Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor.
- GitHub: Version control system used for tracking changes.
- Online Testing Tools: For validating HTML and WCAG compliance. https://validator.w3.org/ and https://wave.webaim.org/
