            <h2>MY BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p class="p-white">I’m currently nearing the end of my first year in the Frontend Development program at Noroff, where I’m mastering the intersection of user experience and system development. My studies focus on creating visually appealing and functional web solutions, blending design processes with programming. This hands-on program emphasizes practical skills and project-based learning, preparing me for a successful career in frontend development.</p>
            <p class="p-white">Previously, I worked as a CRM Manager at Jottacloud, where I collaborated with developers and gained valuable project management experience. Despite initially hesitating to pursue frontend development due to my previous degree in Creativity, Innovation, and Business Development, a toxic work environment motivated me to make the switch. I returned to Jottacloud as a support consultant while pursuing my passion for frontend development.</p>

              <h2 class="h2-black">WHY FRONTEND</h2>
              <p>My choice to study frontend development stems from a desire to engage more actively in the creative process. Although I enjoyed managing projects, I missed the hands-on experience of building and designing tangible products.</p>
              <p>Frontend development allows me to combine my interests in technology and creativity, and I am excited to explore frameworks like React in the upcoming year. I aim to work in meaningful areas such as animal health, environmental sustainability, healthcare, or education.</p>

              <h2 class="h2-black">MY GOALS</h2>
              <p>I aim to begin my career as a frontend developer and work in a product or business department that resonates with my values. My primary focus is to continue growing as a frontend developer, striving to enhance my skills and expertise in the field.</p>
              <p> I appreciate being part of a team while valuing my moments of solitude, which allows me to thrive in both social and quiet settings.</p>
